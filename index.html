      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm an aspiring Web developer who is training and losing weight in order to go the U.S. Air Force  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from New York, born and raised</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing Games, Watching Movies/TV, and Reading</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't have one right now, but that's probably why I am going to the military.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Still in New York, for now. I plan on moving away very soon, though</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was really good back when I was 17 and in High School, winning a Hackathon among other achievements, but as time goes on I forgot these valuable skills and focused on other things. 
        Now I want to regain these skills and am currently starting from the bottom again. </p>
